# Collaborative Kanban Board

## Overview
Create a web-based project management tool featuring customizable kanban boards with collaborative editing capabilities and role-based permissions. This advanced-level challenge focuses on implementing real-time synchronization, conflict resolution, and robust permission systems that protect data integrity.

## Goal
Build a team productivity platform that enables efficient workflow visualization and task management through customizable kanban boards shared across team members with real-time updates and access controls.

## Required Features
- **Customizable boards**: Allow users to create kanban boards with customizable columns representing workflow stages
- **Card management**: Implement a system for creating, editing, and organizing task cards with rich details (descriptions, assignees, due dates, etc.)
- **Drag-and-drop interface**: Create intuitive drag-and-drop functionality for moving cards between columns and reordering within columns
- **Real-time collaboration**: Ensure all changes synchronize instantly across all connected clients
- **Conflict resolution**: Implement intelligent handling of simultaneous edits to prevent data loss or corruption
- **Role-based permissions**: Create a system with distinct access levels (viewer, editor, administrator) at both board and card levels
- **Activity tracking**: Record and display a history of actions and changes to boards and cards
- **Comment system**: Allow users to discuss tasks through comments on individual cards

## Technical Requirements
- Real-time synchronization with fast convergence
- Robust role-based permission enforcement verified by unit and integration tests
- Performant drag-and-drop implementation that maintains responsiveness even with many cards
- Secure authentication system with appropriate access controls
- Efficient state management to handle complex board data

## Deliverables
- GitHub repository with complete source code
- README with setup instructions and feature overview
- 3 ~ 10 screenshots showcasing different app states
- Description of technical decisions and challenges overcome
- (Optional) Link to a YouTube video for a short demo (30 seconds ~ 2 minutes)
- (Optional) Link to the application

## Bonus Ideas (Optional)
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities across boards
- Data visualization of workflow metrics and team productivity
- Time tracking for tasks
- File attachments for cards
